<h2>Hey ༼-つ◕(oo)◕༽つ I'm Mayhul</h2>

I am currently just learning new stuff and having fun. Love to contribute to open source projects and build some personal projects along the way. Also I just love pigs too much.

## ✨ Why I am boring ✨

- Currently exploring `data engineering` in IOT and learning a bit `ML`. 
- Active in `cyberSecurity` space and sometimes play CTFs too. Checkout our [team](https://ctftime.org/team/165779) :)
- `Reverse engineering` is a hobbie of mine which helps me understand the underlying tech
- Anything I do, my core interest still lies in `backend engineering` and just like to solve a problem
